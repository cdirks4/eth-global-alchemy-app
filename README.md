# TikTok Clippers & Content Creators Connect

## Overview
**TikTok Clippers & Content Creators Connect** is a web application designed to bridge the gap between TikTok content creators and clip creators (clippers). This platform allows content creators to create bounties for specific clips they want from their content, and clip creators can browse these bounties, submit their best TikTok clips, and get rewarded for their work.

## Features
- **Wallet & TikTok Integration**: Users can securely connect their crypto wallet and TikTok account to interact with the platform.
- **Role Selection**: Users can choose whether they want to participate as a content creator or a clip creator.
- **Profile Setup**: Tailored profile creation for both content creators and clip creators.
- **Bounty Creation**: Content creators can create bounties with specific clip requirements and reward amounts.
- **Bounty Browsing & Submission**: Clip creators can browse active bounties, select those they are interested in, and submit their TikTok clips for approval.
- **Clip Approval**: Content creators can review submitted clips and approve or reject them.

## Flow

### Landing Page:
- Users are introduced to the app and prompted to connect their wallet and TikTok account.
- Users choose to proceed as either a content creator or a clip creator.

### Profile Setup:
- **Content Creators**: Redirected to `/content-profile` to set up their profile.
- **Clip Creators**: Redirected to `/clipper-profile` to set up their profile.

### Content Creator Actions:
- After setting up their profile, content creators are redirected to `/create-bounties` where they can create new bounties for the clips they need.
- They can also manage and review submissions for their bounties.

### Clip Creator Actions:
- After setting up their profile, clip creators are redirected to `/active-bounties` where they can view all active bounties.
- They can submit their TikTok clips to the bounties they are interested in.


### Bounty Details & Submission (`/bounties/[id]`):
- **Clip Creators**: Can visit a specific bounty page at `/bounties/[id]` to view details and submit their TikTok clip directly to that bounty.
- **Content Creators**: Can access the submissions for a specific bounty at `/bounties/[id]`, review the clips, and either approve or reject them.
Clip creators receive feedback on their submissions, and content creators manage the approval process.

### User Profile Viewing (`/profile/[id]`):
- **Clip Creators**: Can visit `/profile/[id]` to view the account details of content creators. This page will provide information about the content creator, including their linked accounts and any relevant profile details, helping clippers understand who they are working with.

### Smart Contract Bounties
- **Smart Contracts**: Each bounty is stored in a smart contract on the blockchain. This ensures transparency, security, and automation in the reward process.
- **Expiration Time**: Every bounty has a set expiration time. Clip creators must submit their clips before this time to be eligible for the reward.
- **Highest Views Wins**: At the end of the bountyâ€™s duration, the clip with the highest number of views will win the bounty and receive the reward.
- **Automated Reward Distribution**: Once the expiration time is reached, the smart contract automatically checks which clip has the most views and distributes the reward to the creator of that clip.

### Bounty Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Content creators set up a bounty with specific requirements (e.g., clip content, expiration time) and the reward amount. This information is encoded into a smart contract.
2. **Submission**: Clip creators browse active bounties and submit their TikTok clips that meet the specified criteria.
3. **Evaluation**: The submitted clips are tracked for their view count. The clip with the highest view count at the expiration time wins the bounty.
4. **Completion**: Once the expiration time is reached, the smart contract automatically evaluates all submissions. The reward is distributed to the creator of the clip with the highest view count.
